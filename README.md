# Electricity-Load-and-renewable-energy-forecasting-by-utilizing-machine-learning-models 

Uses of renewable energy sources have been increased and integrated into power grid which means is 
managing these sources in the grid is becoming vital in terms of grid reliability and stability. Hence, forecasting 
of the most promising sources, wind and solar, is becoming more important for efficient and effective power 
grid operation. On the other hand, designing stable and reliable smart grid requires an accurate forecasting of 
electricity load, which uses historical load/demand data and its related factors to forecast. In this case, we aimed 
to develop accurate forecasting models by comparing their results to find out the best model for this task. 
Therefore, we utilized different machine learning models in both traditional and advanced deep learning models 
to make comparisons. More weather parameters were used in understanding correlations between them. The 
proposed models were used to forecast 2-hour and 1-week ahead electrical load of NEMA zone in New 
England. The proposed LSTM model exhibits remarkable performance to all other models by obtaining with 
lowest values of 0.047, 0.062, 0.003, with metrics of MAE, RMSE, MSE, respectively. R2 value of 0.902, which 
was close to 1, as well. For wind power forecasting side, RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2 of proposed XGBoost are, 
0.208, 0.043, 0.162, and 0.078, respectively. In solar power forecast, proposed XGBoost is evaluated with four 
metrics e.g. MAE, MSE, R2
, RMSE, and 0.088, 0.024, 0.714, 0.155, respectively.
